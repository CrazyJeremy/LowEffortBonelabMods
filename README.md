# LowEffortBonelabMods
 The Unity project for my Low Effort Mods collection


I have uploaded 2 out of 3 promised mods, and because of time constraints I probably will never finish the third one. Oops
Check out the first two mods here:

# The crossbow:https://mod.io/g/bonelab/m/crossbow-kip-lem1
# The Matrix Neo avatar: mod.io/g/bonelab/m/neo-kip-lem2

modify it however you want, maybe make it actually polished or something idk


# SDK
This project used https://github.com/CrazyJeremy/ExtendedFlaskMarrowSDK . It is a combination of the Flask SDK and the extended SDK. More info at the repo. Feel free to use it and this project in any way you'd like.
